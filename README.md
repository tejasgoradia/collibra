### What is an Edge Server
Edge is a cluster of Linux servers for accessing and processing data close to where it resides. It helps to connect to data sources and process information within your data landscape.

Edge enables Collibra Data Intelligence Cloud to safely connect to your data sources hosted in an on-premise or cloud environment. It processes the data source information on the Edge site and sends the process results to Collibra Data Intelligence Cloud
